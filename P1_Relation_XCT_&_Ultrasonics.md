**Relation between X-ray computed tomography (XCT) and ultrasonic testing(UT) for the study of porosity:** An opportunity was found in the data fusion. In the one hand, XCT provides a 3D volume with very high resolution and detail of the defects (20um), but it demands more expensive equipment, and higher inspection and  analysis times than ultrasonic testing. On the other hand, ultrasonic testing does not provide enough detail and its results are difficult to interpret in occasions.

### 1. Hypothesis 1: The XCT and UT techniques can be related to study the amount of porosity in a composite material.

The video of the left shows the segmented binary volume of XCT where you can see the porosity as the white structures. The video of the right is a render of 4 ultrasonic volumes and the inspection area with its supports, it is possible to see the reflection at the bottom of the water container.

### 2. Work carried out: Develop a methodology to automate the measurement of properties in the 3D volumes of XCT and UT.

It was time to start to get data from the available composite material. The work included carrying out inspection by XCT and ultrasonic testing, the coding of the methodology and the automation in the analysis of the results.

### 3. Outcome: An image shows the clear correlation between the measurement of porosity in XCT, and the attenuation obtained from the UT.

### 4. Followup work: Develop models to estimate porosity measured in XCT by features of the ultrasonic data.

The next goal is to be able to predict the porosity quantity from ultrasonic features. In the next project link, the data science methodology with the data splitting techniques, modeling, and error analysis is presented.
